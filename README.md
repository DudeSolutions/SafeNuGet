OWASP SafeNuGet
===============
MsBuild task to warn about insecure NuGet libraries:
https://nuget.org/packages/SafeNuGet/

Use of libraries with known vulnerabilities is a big problem. So big in fact it has now made it to the [OWASP Top 10 2013](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10#OWASP_Top_10_for_2013). It's under [A9 Using Known Vulnerable Components](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities).

Installation
------------
1. Install the NuGet package
